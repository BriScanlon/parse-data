AAIB Field Investigation

Synopsis

G-CUBX tracked to the left on the runway during takeoff and within two seconds of getting
airborne  it  was  in  a  left  turn  tracking  toward  obstacles  south  of  the  runway.    Witnesses
reported  seeing  the  aircraft  adopt  a  steep  nose-up  attitude,  but  it  was  not  able  to  climb
above a tree which was one of the obstacles in its path.  G-CUBX appeared to have struck
the tree at the apogee of its flight path before descending steeply, nose-first, into the ground.
The pilot suffered fatal injuries at the point of ground collision.

It was not possible to conclusively establish why the aircraft diverged left during and after
takeoff.  Nonetheless, the investigation considered it likely the relatively low lift off speed of
approximately 34 kt contributed to the pilot having insufficient aerodynamic control authority
to  effectively  counter  the  flight  path  divergence.    Being  in  a  turn  rather  than  wings  level
would have compromised the aircraft’s climb rate resulting in it being unable to climb above
the obstacles it was turning toward.

The investigation was unable to find evidence of any pre-accident fault with the aircraft.

History of the flight

The accident occurred on the pilot’s second flight in G-CUBX.  The first time he flew the
aircraft he occupied the rear seat with an instructor in the front.  On the accident flight he
flew solo from the front seat.

On the morning of the accident, the pilot used a remote-controlled aircraft tug to manoeuvre
G-CUBX  out  of  its  hangar  before  completing  his  pre-flight  checks.   After  initially  having
trouble  starting  the  engine,  he  taxied  out  for  departure  from  Runway  28.   As  the  aircraft
entered the runway to backtrack, its wing flaps were retracted (Figure 1).

Captured on CCTV, while at low speed during the initial phase of the takeoff roll, the aircraft
swung to the left before being re-aligned to the runway by the pilot (Figure 2).

to progress normally, with the aircraft’s tailwheel lifting off just before the aircraft went out
of view (Figure 3).  Approximately nine seconds later the aircraft reappeared in the CCTV
image,  close  to  the  camera  and  in  a  steep  nose  down  attitude  just  before  it  struck  the
ground.  While the CCTV footage was not of a sufficiently high definition to reach a definitive
conclusion,  it  appeared  to  show  G-CUBX’s  wing  flaps  in  the  retracted  position  before  it
struck the ground.

Two  eyewitnesses  described  the  aircraft’s  initial  climb  away  from  the  ground  as  being
steeper than expected.  They both reported the engine note sounded normal throughout
the short flight.  One of the eyewitnesses was inside a hangar, so their view of the aircraft
after its initial climb away from the ground was limited by the building structure.  The second
eyewitness  described  how,  at  a  low  height,  G-CUBX’s  left  wing  dropped  and  the  aircraft
entered a steep left turn.  It then descended, striking the ground in front of where he was
stood.

CCTV footage revealed that the fire which subsequently consumed the aircraft started near
the cockpit area within three seconds of ground impact.

Accident site

While video footage of the accident shows the aircraft initially coming to rest on its nose with
the tail almost vertically above it, during the subsequent post-accident fire the tail settled
to the ground with the top of the vertical stabilizer resting on the floor.  The fuselage was
inverted and there was significant damage to the structure (Figure 4).

Figure 4

Ground impact marks show the point where the leading edge of the left wing tip struck the
ground before the fuselage pivoted around this initial contact point causing the spinner dome
of the propeller to hit the ground.  One of the two blades of the propeller was embedded in
the ground and, once recovered, showed evidence of twisting consistent with the engine
being under power when the aircraft struck the ground.

Twigs from a nearby tree were caught in the tail wheel giving a good indication of the flight
path of the aircraft and the height at the point contact was made with the top of the tree.
A continuity check revealed that all flight controls remained connected to their respective
control surfaces.  The exception was the right flap where the bell crank was missing and
most  of  the  flap  had  melted  away.    The  left  flap  had  also  partially  melted  but  remained
attached to the wing with the control cables still connected between the bell crank and flap
control lever in the cockpit.

The left wing and wing struts remained attached to the fuselage, although the right wing was
detached at its root.  The right wing struts, although bent and showing signs of significant
fire damage, also remained attached to the wing and the fuselage.

dead grass which was likely to have been caused by fuel dripping onto the ground during
attempts to start the engine.  CCTV footage showed that the technician who replaced the
ignition harness attended the aircraft while the pilot was struggling to start the engine.  He
stated that when he lifted the cowlings, there was fuel dripping onto the air box.  He regarded
the dripping fuel as a sign of a potentially flooded engine.  According to the O-320 engine
operator’s manual1, ‘Cranking periods must be limited to ten (10) to twelve (12) seconds
with a five (5) minute rest between cranking periods.’  Whilst there were multiple attempts
made to start the engine, there was very little time between cranking attempts which was
likely to have exacerbated the difficulty the pilot had in starting the engine.

Recorded information

The pilot was using a flight-planning and navigation app on a tablet device which recorded
the aircraft’s GPS flight path.  The ground track is shown in Figure 5.  Note that the path
stops short of the accident site by about three seconds as the recorded positions during
this period were unreliable, probably as a result of the aircraft’s banked attitude limiting the
tablet’s view of the GPS satellites.

data.  These data show the aircraft initially lining up on the grass strip before beginning the
take off at time 09:32:32.

After five seconds of gentle manoeuvring right, left and right again, the aircraft accelerated
down the grass strip, veering slightly left, with the tail of the aircraft coming off the ground
10 seconds later (before going out of view of the CCTV).  Within two seconds, the aircraft
was airborne, after which it climbed at an average flight path angle of 14° and reached the
maximum recorded groundspeed of 34 kt.  Now turning left, the rate of climb reduced with
the aircraft flying over the left edge of the grass strip at just over 10 m height.

The last recorded reliable position was four seconds later when the aircraft contacted a tree,
40 m to the left of the grass strip edge, at a height of about 15 m.  Continuing to turn, and roll
left, the aircraft came back into CCTV view descending vertically in a nose-down attitude,
wings aligned with the grass strip, left wing first.

Aircraft information and brief history

The aircraft was a Piper PA18-150 Super Cub with a Lycoming O-320 horizontally opposed
four-cylinder  engine.    Built  in  1981  and  first  registered  in  Greece,  it  had  three  previous
registrations before being transferred from Germany to the UK and being re-registered as
G-CLYI in 2021.  It was modified to include an Alaskan Bush fit which included large tundra
tyres, Alaskan tail wheel, modified heavy duty landing gear and a 31.5 USG belly fuel tank.

whilst  braking  shortly  after  touching  down  on  a  grass  landing  strip.    The  aircraft  spent
13 months undergoing repairs during which it was re-registered as G-CUBX in June 2024
(Figure 7).  The engine was shock load tested by an approved engine workshop and refitted
during the repairs.  To improve stall performance and enhance the short takeoff and landing
capability  of  the  aircraft,  vortex  generators  had  been  fitted  just  aft  of  the  wings’  upper
leading edges and on the lower surfaces of the horizontal stabilizer, forward of the elevator
hinges.  These were also replaced during the repair process.  G-CUBX received a CAA UK
Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC) on 11 July 2024.

After  handing  over  the  repaired  aircraft  to  the  new  owners,  the  aircraft  was  returned  to
the  repair  workshop  on  22  July  2024  because  the  owner  reported  ‘The  aircraft  rolls  to
left in flight3.’  During the original repairs, the right forward wing strut had been replaced.
Subsequent comparison of the left and right wingtip incidence angles, called ‘wash-out’4,
showed a 2.5º difference between them.  The right wing aft strut was adjusted to remove the
incidence difference and the aircraft was flown to confirm that the roll to the left had been
eliminated.  This was re-confirmed by the owner during the return flight home to Croft Farm
Airstrip.

On  16  August  2024,  multiple  problems  were  found  with  the  ignition  system  including
inoperative spark plugs, poor condition of the ignition harness and timing problems with the
right magneto.  The ignition harness and spark plugs were replaced and the right magneto
removed,  reset  and  refitted.    Engine  ground  runs  were  carried  out  to  verify  the  ignition
system was functioning correctly and the two magnetos produced the correct reduction in
engine rpm when ‘mag-drop’ checked.  During the ground run, the technician believed he
had witnessed a slow deployment of the left flap when compared to the right, although both
flaps appeared to stop in their correct, fully deployed positions.

Aircraft examination

Engine

The  engine  was  subject  to  a  strip  examination.    Nothing  significant  was  found  with  the
mechanical  and  electrical  components  that  could  not  be  attributed  to  damage  sustained
when the aircraft struck the ground or the post-impact fire.

Airframe

According to the FAA Supplemental Type Certificate5, if more than five Vortex Generators
are  missing  or  damaged,  the  aircraft  is  not  airworthy.    It  was  not  possible  to  check  the
Vortex Generators because they had been glued to the fabric of the wing and the horizontal
stabiliser but the fabric had burned away in the fire.  Pictures taken shortly after delivery
of the restored aircraft show most of the generators fitted to the wings and left horizontal
stabiliser.    In  addition,  the  pilot  could  be  seen  checking  the  aircraft  surfaces  as  part  of
his pre-flight inspection of the aircraft, therefore, he would likely have noticed if any were
missing or damaged.

Whilst  the  right  flap  bell  crank  was  missing  (Figure  8),  the  turnbuckle  that  should  have
attached the flap control cable to the bell crank was intact and still attached to the control
cable, link and return spring.  The bell crank hinge bracket remained in place and attached
to  the  wing.   The  push  pull  flap  rod,  which  should  have  connected  the  bell  crank  to  the
inboard flap hinge bracket, remained attached to the bracket but the bracket had separated
from the flap.  The left flap control assembly was still connected to the left bell crank and
flap although the wing spar section that held bell crank hinge bracket had melted releasing
the bracket and bell crank.

It was not possible to examine the seat harnesses or any of the seat fabric because they
had  all  been  destroyed  in  the  fire.    The  front  seat  had  been  torn  from  its  mounting  and
distorted by the impact and the fire.  Cockpit instrument panels, switches, control system
levers and electrical wiring were also significantly damaged or destroyed.

On examining the various control cables from the cockpit controls to the control surfaces
in more detail, no pre-existing restriction or incorrect routing was found.  The slow left flap
deployment issue reported by the technician who replaced the ignition harness could not be
confirmed due to the absence of the left flap bell crank and the significant damage to both
left and right flap systems, structure and control surfaces.  A comparison of the tension force
of the flap control return springs could not be made as both springs were damaged.  Whilst
most of the airframe and wings were badly damaged, the wings, tail and fuselage structure,
including their drag support wires, were still present and no pre-existing faults were found.

The pitch trim, elevator, vertical stabiliser and rudder connections were still functional, and
no  issues  were  identified  that  were  not  caused  by  the  accident  or  the  fire.    Whilst  both
ailerons had also been damaged by the fire, they remained connected to their respective
cockpit controls and control cables.

Survivability

The post-mortem confirmed that, despite the pilot wearing a four-point seat safety harness,
at the point of collision he sustained multiple injuries which were not survivable.

The  Owners’  Handbook  (OH)  for  the  aircraft  states  that  at  maximum  gross  weight,  the
‘power off stalling speed with full flaps in the Super Cub “150” is 43 mph [(37.4 kt)]: with flaps
up the stalling speed increases [by] about 4 mph [(3.5 kt)].’

G-CUBX  was  fitted  with  vortex  generators  to  improve  its  short  takeoff  and  landing
performance.  The Supplementary Type Certificate documentation for the vortex generator
modification indicated that fitting them would reduce the aircraft’s stalling speed by 16%.

In  2019  a  PA-18-50  fitted  with  vortex  generators  like  those  on  G-CUBX  was  destroyed
when it lifted off unexpectedly while stationary on the ground with its engine running6.  The
accident pilot ascribed the unexpected lift off to strong winds and opined that ‘a gust of 25 kt
would be sufficient to lift the aircraft into the air but that in a pre-take-off scenario there is not
the necessary airspeed to the ailerons to counteract a rolling tendency once the wind has
lifted the aircraft into the air.’

Regarding  flap  deployment  for  takeoff,  the  OH  is  not  prescriptive,  stating  that  ‘the  flaps
can be lowered if desired, but should be retracted as soon as climbing airspeed has been
reached...’.

Ground effect may lead to an initial airborne state which cannot be sustained as distance
from runway surface increases and the additional lift attributable to ground effect reduces.7
For  fixed  wing  aircraft,  this  additional  lift  reduces  to  zero  at  a  height  above  the  ground
equivalent to the wingspan of the aircraft, which for the PA-18 is 11 m (Figure 6).

Meteorology

At the time of the accident good weather prevailed.  There was no low cloud, and visibility
was more than 10 km.  While generally from a southerly direction, the surface wind was light
and variable, giving a maximum estimated crosswind component of 5 kt.

Airfield information

Croft  Farm Airstrip  (also  known  as  Defford Airfield)  is  a  private  unlicensed  airfield  with  a
single  grass  strip  570  m  long  and  18  m  wide,  designated  Runway  10/28.    Extending  for
approximately 200 m from the threshold, an electrified livestock fence initially delineates the
left (south) edge of Runway 28 (Figure 11).

The accident pilot had over 1,500 total flight hours gained in non-commercial flying.  His
recent  flying  experience  was  exclusively  on  tailwheel  aircraft  including  the  Piper  J3-65
Cub,  Harvard  and  P51  Mustang  types.    He  had  regularly  flown  from  and  was  familiar
with operating at Croft Farm.  He did not have any significant underlying medical issues,
and the post-mortem did not find evidence of chronic or acute conditions to indicate pilot
incapacitation as a causal factor.

Other information

Adverse aileron yaw

When an aileron is deflected downwards the drag it generates increases.  This results in
a  drag  differential  between  the  two  wing  surfaces  which  generates  a  yawing  moment  in
the  opposite  sense  to  the  applied  roll.    With  a  right  roll  input  the  left  aileron  is  deflected
downwards and the resulting yawing moment is to the left.

Swing on takeoff

Due  to  a  combination  of  factors,  propeller-driven  aircraft  tend  to  ‘swing’  to  one  side  on
take-off, this requires pilots to compensate with opposite rudder.  For nosewheel-equipped
aircraft, the two primary factors generating swing on takeoff are slipstream effect and torque
reaction.   These  effects  are  explained  below  and  assume  the  aircraft  is  equipped  with  a
clockwise rotating propeller (the same as G-CUBX).  On aircraft with propellers which rotate
in an anticlockwise direction, the divergent effects are in the opposite sense ie to the right.

 ● Slipstream effect: the propeller’s rotation produces an asymmetric flow over

the fin and rudder, thereby inducing a left yawing moment (Figure 9).

Left yaw due to propeller slipstream (viewed from above the aircraft)

Figure 9

All times are UTC©  Crown copyright 2025 AAIB Bulletin:    AAIB Bulletin:  G-CUBX AAIB-30327 ● Torque  reaction:  torque  reaction  from  driving  the  propeller  imparts  a  left
rolling moment on the aircraft (Figure 10).  During the takeoff roll this results
in  more  weight  being  supported  by  the  left  wheel  thereby  increasing  its
rolling resistance and giving rise to a tendency to swing left until the aircraft
is airborne.

Figure 10

Torque reaction producing rolling moment

For tailwheel aircraft there are two additional factors that can affect swing during the takeoff
roll:

 ● Asymmetric blade effect: while the aircraft’s tail is down, the plane of rotation
of the propeller is not at right angles to the direction of forward motion.  This
means the down-going propeller blade has a higher speed relative to the
airflow than the upgoing blade, this produces more thrust for given angle of
attack and leads to an asymmetric left yawing moment.  As the tail is raised
and  the  propeller’s  plane  of  rotation  becomes  more  perpendicular  to  the
relative airflow the asymmetric blade effect reduces towards zero.

 ● Gyroscopic precession: as the tail is raised, a force is applied to the top of the
propeller disc in a nose-down sense.  The resulting gyroscopic precession
force induces yaw/swing to the left.

Analysis

Despite the difficulty experienced by the pilot when initially starting the engine, eyewitness
reports indicated it was operating normally throughout the brief flight.  CCTV evidence was
inconclusive, but the aircraft did not appear to have its wing flaps selected down for takeoff.
The Owners’ Handbook stated that the power off stalling speed with flaps retracted would
have been approximately 41 kt at maximum takeoff weight, but did not contain a means for
interpolating stalling speeds based on gross weight, or intermediate flap settings.  Applying
the 16% stall speed reduction stated in the vortex generator Supplemental Type Certificate
documentation to the OH figures, would give a power off stalling speed of 34.5 kt in the
clean configuration.

All times are UTC©  Crown copyright 2025 AAIB Bulletin:    AAIB Bulletin:  G-CUBX AAIB-30327The investigation did not find conclusive evidence to explain why the pilot lifted off at 34 kt
groundspeed or for the steep climb and apparent loss of effective control.  The investigation
considered the aircraft’s ground roll track converging with the electrified fence bordering the
southern edge of the runway (Figure 11) could have been a contributory factor if the pilot
decided to lift off earlier than perhaps he originally intended.

G-CUBX’s approximate ground track and flightpath (aircraft drawn to scale)

Figure 11

Getting  airborne  at  relatively  low  speed,  potentially  without  wing  flaps  deployed  and  in
a  semi-stalled  condition,  would  likely  have  generated  only  limited  aerodynamic  control
authority  for  the  pilot  to  correct  the  heading  divergence  which  appears  to  have  occurred
almost immediately after lift-off.  Applying right aileron to level the wings could have led to
adverse aileron yaw exacerbating any tendency for the aircraft to swing and roll left.  Using
right  rudder,  rather  than  aileron,  to  correct  the  heading  divergence  would  have  been  an
appropriate action, although limited aerodynamic directional control authority would have
made such a correction more difficult.  The investigation considered it likely some of the
adverse factors pre-disposing the aircraft to swing left on takeoff were contributory factors
in the pilot not being able to re-establish a safe longitudinal trajectory.   However, lacking
evidence to support detailed analysis, it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion in
this regard.

13

All times are UTC©  Crown copyright 2025 AAIB Bulletin:    AAIB Bulletin:  G-CUBX AAIB-30327Once the aircraft had started turning left towards the trees and buildings the pilot needed to
reverse the turn or climb to avoid a collision.  As the aircraft climbed through approximately
11 m any lift benefit from ground effect would have been lost and being in a turn would have
further compromised the aircraft’s achievable rate of climb.

At very low height and heading toward obstructions, pulling up to try and clear the obstacles
would have been an instinctive pilot reaction.  Given that twigs were found in the tail wheel
landing gear it is very likely that the aircraft was not able to avoid the trees.

There  were  no  pre-existing  mechanical  issues  identified  with  the  aircraft  during  detailed
examination after the accident that would explain the deviation from the runway centreline
or  the  subsequent  circumstances  leading  to  the  accident.    Evidence  from  eyewitnesses,
CCTV  footage  and  ground  marks,  plus  the  damage  caused  to  the  engine  and  propeller,
indicate that the engine was under power when the ground collision occurred.

Conclusion

G-CUBX tracked to the left on the runway during takeoff and within two seconds of getting
airborne it was in a left turn tracking toward obstacles south of the runway; one of these
obstacles was the tree which G-CUBX appears to have struck at the apogee of its flight
path.    It  was  not  possible  to  conclusively  establish  why  the  aircraft  diverged  left  during
and  after  takeoff.    Nonetheless,  the  investigation  considered  it  likely  the  relatively  low
lift  off  speed  contributed  to  the  pilot  having  insufficient  aerodynamic  control  authority  to
effectively counter the flight path divergence.  Being in a turn rather than wings level would
have compromised the aircraft’s climb rate resulting in it being unable to climb above the
obstacles in its flight path.

The investigation was unable to find evidence of any pre-accident fault with the aircraft.
